	<h1>Using deep learning to recognise, optimise, and generate images.</h1>
	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
	<p style = "font-size: 15px;clear:left;">We will be using the mnist dataset to recongise, optimise and generate handwritten digits. I used the programming language Python to create this project. In the practical world this could be used to digitalise handwritten notes or convert digital text to handwritten notes. An example of the letter 5 in our dataset is shown below:</p>

	<h2 style="clear:left;"><br>Recognition:</h2>
	<p style = "font-size: 15px;clear:left;">To classify our handwritten digits we will use conversational neural networks (CNN). 60,000 images are used to train our network, remaining 10,000 which can be used to calculate he accuracy of our model. I compared adapative moment estimation (ADAM) to stochastic gradient descent for being used as the model's optimizer and as theorised I conluded ADAM was the more accurate option, increasing accuracy by 0.4%. The results show the epoch count (how many times the network propagates and backpropagates the data) against the accuracy. After 20 we can see our validation accuracy (the unseen test data) has plateaued at approximetly 99.3%. The model also predicts our 5 above to be a 5. Testing the model on different datasets produce good results too, classifying clothes achieved a 91.07% accuracy. </p>

	<h2 style="clear:left;">Optimisation:</h2>
	<p style = "font-size: 15px;">A method to reduce noise in images is programming autoencoders. The below image shows the noisy images above the denoised images.</p>

	<h2 style="clear:left;">Generation:</h2>
	<p style = "font-size: 15px;">Generative neural networks can be implemented to create completely new images based of the dataset it was trained on. Below is the results for 20 generated digits. See how many you can recognise!</p>

	<h2 style="clear:left;">Conclusion:</h2>
	<p style = "font-size: 15px;"> Image recognition and image denoising have been completed to a strong level. Generation of images is more complex, models produce numbers, some more interpretable than others.
